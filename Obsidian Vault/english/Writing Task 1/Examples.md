The pie charts show the amount of revenue and expenditures in 2016 for a children’s charity in the USA. ==Overall, it can be seen that== donated food ==accounted for the majority of the== income, while program services accounted for the most expenditure. Total revenue sources just exceeded outgoings.

In detail, donated food ==provided most of the== revenue for the charity, at 86%. ==Similarly, with regard to expenditures==, one category, program services, accounted for nearly all of the outgoings, at 95.8%. 

The other categories were much smaller. Community contributions, which were the second largest revenue source, brought in 10.4% of overall income, and this was followed by program revenue, at 2.2%. Investment income, government grants, and other income were very small sources of revenue, ==accounting for only 0.8% combined==.

There were only two other expenditure items, fundraising and management and general, accounting for 2.6% and 1.6% respectively. The total amount of income was $53,561,580, which was just enough to cover the expenditures of $53,224,896.

The pie chart illustrates the percentage of males and females who were arrested from 1989 to 1994, while the bar chart compares the main reasons that the different genders were arrested most recently. ==It is evident from the charts that== males were arrested more than females and that public drinking was the most common reason for arrest for both.

To begin, the proportion of males arrested was much greater than for females.  32% were arrested compared to only 9% for women. Turning to the reasons for the most recent arrests, there were some clear differences between men and women. Men were twice as likely to be arrested for drink driving than women, at 26% and 14% respectively. Breach of order, theft, and other reasons were also slightly higher for men, with all these offences standing in the range of 12-18% for both sexes.   

Interestingly though, women experienced a higher percentage of arrest rates for assault and public drinking. ==The figures for assault were fairly similar at approximately 18%==, whereas public drinking represented the main reason for arrest, with women at a massive 38%, compared to 31% for men. In a small percentage of cases, no answer was given.

The line graph illustrates the number of visitors in millions from the UK who went abroad and those that came to the UK between 1979 and 1999, while the bar chart shows which countries were the most popular for UK residents to visit in 1999. Overall, it can be seen that visits to and from the UK increased, and that France was the most popular country to go to.

To begin, the number of visits abroad by UK residents was higher than for those that came to the UK, and ==this remained so throughout the period==. ==The figures started at a similar amount==, around 10 million, but visits abroad increased significantly to over 50 million, whereas the number of overseas residents ==rose steadily to reach just under 30 million==.

By far the most popular countries to visit in 1999 were France at approximately 11 million visitors, ==followed by Spain at 9 million==. The USA, Greece, and Turkey were far less popular at around 4, 3 and 2 million visitors respectively.

The bar chart shows the number of British people who emigrated to five destinations over the period 2004 to 2007. ==It is evident from the chart that throughout the period, the most popular place to move to was Australia.==

Emigration to Australia ==stood at just over 40,000 people== in 2004, which was approximately 6,000 higher than for Spain, and twice as high as the other three countries. ==Apart from a jump to around 52,000 in 2006, it remained around this level throughout the period.==

The next most popular country for Britons to move to was Spain, though its ==popularity declined over the time frame to finish at below 30,000 in 2007==. Despite this, the figure was still higher than for the remaining three countries. Approximately 20,000 people emigrated to New Zealand each year, while the USA ==fluctuated between 20-25,000 people over the period==.

Although the number of visitors to France spiked to nearly 35,000 in 2005, it was the country that was the least popular to emigrate to at the end of the period, at just under 20,000 people.
