Some individuals ==believe that, the== government waste ==enormous== funds on space ==researches== although it ==should be invested== in more vital matters. I am convinced that space ~~investigations~~ exploration are hugely useful according to many benefits of exploration achievements. For instance, without satellite communications it would have been difficult to contact people in hard-to-reach regions. Another advantage of space research is improvement of understanding of universe's set of rules. 
	Firstly, plenty of modern technologies could not be developed without investigations in cosmic sphere. Outer space is an extremely useful field, owing to distinguished, compairing to Earth, gravitation and missing air content. One of the most valuable result of cosmic research is satellite. It is indeed beneficial, due to the fact that it is difficult to maintain communication with remote places. For instance, it would be impossible to perform a salvage operation from the mount Everest. According to satellite communications, it is possible to contact injured despite the snowstorm and avalanche.
		Secondly, comprehension of university is extremely profitable and could not be achieved without space research. It is impossible to grow without investigations and expected next step in development of humanity could be space exploration. Moreover, knowledge about how our planet appeared, what other planets look like and what kind of atmosphere they have, whether there is life on them is very important even for our life on earth, on the grounds that we must appreciate and protect Earth by compairing our atmosphere with planets where, for example, there is no ozone layer.

Many countries have added obligatory volunteer programmes for adolescents to provide support to seniors, make socially benefitial work and assist ~~living~~ alive creatures. I am inclined to think that this strategy is indeed benefitial both for adults and social services. This programme would lead to improve ~~socializing~~ ==socialization== between young people regardless to fact that teamwork unites. Also strategy of ==popularizing (popularize (inf))== volunteer events will relieve the load on social services. Nevertheless, mandatory community work would increase the teenagers stress even more.
	In one hand, large burden on teenager could lead to serious emotional issues, in case the adolescents already have many concerns such as exams, anxiety, relationship, moreover significant part ot young generation works to have allowance. Some obligatory work, even if it is socially beneficial, would heighten workload on teenagers and trigger disputes. For example, exhausted from school and work, social services helping could initiate cumulatived anger, fatigue to come out and make situation worse.
		In the other hand, obligatory public duty programmes would improve social integration between adolescents. It is important to have social life in such young age, owing to the fact that the mentality is developing and lack of communication could cause emotional damage, especially feeling of loneliness. Cooperative working could bring joint topics for conversation and even shy teenagers would have an opportunity to find friends. For instance, many individuals make acquaintance in interest groups such as sport or art, therefore partnership in some social helping work would be effective alike.

Many individuals think that travelling is damaging to the flora and it must be restricted, however others argue that it is helpful, moreover, it must be support for tourists. It seems to me that travelling is extremely profitable, on the grounds that it brings enormous funds to the country's budget and economical level will be improved by promoting tourism in its regions. In other hand, some travellers missing respect to the place of stay and actually poison nature with rubbish, campfires and other ==irreverent== methods.

Some governments are on the opinion that their highest ==aim== is to improve country economics, while others argue that finances are not so important, moreover, there are many other indicators of growth. In my mind, quality of life depends a lot on country’s wealth and further spheres would be upgraded if it will be an high economy level. Firstly, with great economic there are more jobs and both an unemployment and criminality level will go down. Secondly, more social cervices programmes could be funded by government, which will provide an support to animals, elders, disabled people.

Many people believe that an extra concurrent atmosphere could have positive influence equally for schools, universities and place of employment, while others argue it have opposite impact. It seems to me climate like this have plenty beneficial effects, owing to motivation inspired by ==entourage==. Moreover, concominant environment is profitable because of making contacts with interesting people and such as atmosphere broaden one's mind.  Although there are some negative results in psycological issues such as fear of missing out, burnout, consistent comparing by achievements.
